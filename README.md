# Blanket [![Clojars project](https://img.shields.io/clojars/v/com.github.vlaaad/blanket.svg)](https://clojars.org/com.github.vlaaad/blanket)

*Soft* encapsulation for Clojure data structures

# Rationale

There is value in hiding data even when it's immutable: drawing a line between
public API and implementation details. You might want to create a library (or 
module in an application) that allows it's users to create some entity and then 
pass it back to you to other functions. It creates a problem: users might start 
using internals of returned data structure, even though they are not intended to 
be used. You still want to be able to change shape of this data in the future 
without breaking your users' code, so you write in your documentation that shape 
of your entity is internal and subject to change, hoping that people will read 
and remember it... And this is where Blanket steps in: it shows users of your 
library — at the REPL — that part of what you give them is implementation 
details.

Blanket is extremely lightweight and non-intrusive: it changes covered objects' 
metadata to only affect printing, so your covered hash-map is still the same 
hash-map, and your covered vector is still the same vector, with all equality 
semantics etc. retained. It does not really prevent any access, just helps your 
users to get better understanding of your library's API contracts (hence *soft* 
encapsulation).

# Install

Using git dependency:
```edn
com.github.vlaaad/blanket {:git/url "https://github.com/vlaaad/blanket"
                           :sha "3f54f3cfec43f9de67cda56cc2ec1d88d7936951"}
```

Using maven:
```edn
com.github.vlaaad/blanket {:mvn/version "1.1.0"}
```

# Usage
```clojure
(ns service
  (:require [blanket.core :as blanket]))

;; mark data structure as namespace-local, optionally set how it's printed
(def async-config
  (blanket/cover {:async true} :print-method (blanket/print-as 'async-config)))

;; in same namespace, you'll still see it
(prn async-config) 
=> {:async true}
;; in other namespace, you wont see it
(in-ns 'service-user)
(clojure.core/prn service/async-config) 
=> #impl[service async-config]
(in-ns 'service)

(defn make [opts]
  ;; Since `make` can be called from other namespace, we should specify 
  ;; encapsulation namespace directly (*ns* will be different)
  (blanket/cover {:opts opts} :ns 'service))

(in-ns 'service-user)
(clojure.core/prn (service/make {:some :opts})) ;; => #impl[service 0x7c6442c2]
(in-ns 'service)

;; here goes remaining API...
(defn perform-request [service config] ,,,)
```
